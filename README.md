# LFX Mentorship Metrics

This is the frontend repository for the LFX Mentorship Metrics project. The whole project is powered by `Astro` and `React`.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. You can either setup the backend yourself from [this repository](https://github.com/EshaanAgg/LFX-Backend) or you can use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to setup the same with `docker compose up`.
2. Create a copy of the [sample .env file](./.env.sample) and rename the same to `.env`.
3. Install the dependencies of the project with `npm i`.
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.

You can generate the production bundle and test it out locally with the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
